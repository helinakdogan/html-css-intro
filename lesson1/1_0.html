    <h2> MY TITLE</h2>
    <div class="change">The Blue Whales just played their first baseball game of the new season; I believe there is much
        to be excited about. Although they lost, it was against an excellent team that had won the championship last
        year. The Blue Whales fell behind early but showed excellent teamwork and came back to tie the game. The team
        had 15 hits and scored 8 runs. That’s excellent! Unfortunately, they had 5 fielding errors, which kept the other
        team in the lead the entire game. The game ended with the umpire making a bad call, and if the call had gone the
        other way, the Blue Whales might have actually won the game. It wasn’t a victory, but I say the Blue Whales look
        like they have a shot at the championship, especially if they continue to improve.

    <div id="second">On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its
        mission was to go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael
        Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain,
        on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander
        Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He
        declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human
        history!
