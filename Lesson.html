            On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its
            mission was to go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong,
            Michael
            Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood
            plain,
            on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT,
            Commander
            Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He
            declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human
            history!
